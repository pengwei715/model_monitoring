# Model Monitoring Module Structure

This repository is dedicated to implementing model monitoring functionalities, crucial for maintaining the reliability and efficiency of machine learning models in production. We explore two structuring approaches: **Vendor-Based Structuring** and **Drift-Type-Based Structuring**.

## Approach 1: Vendor-Based Structuring

In this approach, the module is structured based on different vendors, such as Evidently, DeepCheck, etc. Each vendor's unique tools and functionalities are encapsulated within their respective submodules.

### Pros:
1. **Vendor Specialization**: Facilitates the use of specialized tools and features offered by each vendor, maximizing the benefits of their unique capabilities.
2. **Ease of Comparison**: Allows for straightforward comparison and benchmarking between different vendors' tools.
3. **Flexible Integration**: Simplifies the integration of new vendors and their tools into the existing framework.

### Cons:
1. **Dependency on Vendors**: Reliance on external vendors may lead to issues if a vendor's service changes, becomes deprecated, or encounters downtime.
2. **Learning Curve**: Users may need to familiarize themselves with multiple vendors' systems and APIs, increasing the learning curve.
3. **Potentially Redundant Features**: Different vendors might offer overlapping functionalities, leading to redundancy in the module.

## Approach 2: Drift-Type-Based Structuring

This approach structures the module based on different types of drift, akin to the structure seen in the Frouros project. It focuses on categorizing functionalities based on the nature of the drift being monitored.

### Pros:
1. **Focus on Drift Types**: Provides a clear focus on various drift types, facilitating a more targeted approach to monitoring.
2. **Unified Interface**: Offers a consistent interface and methodology for dealing with different types of drifts, regardless of the underlying vendor tool.
3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Encourages a more holistic view of model performance and health by covering a broad spectrum of drift types.

### Cons:
1. **Complexity in Handling Vendor-Specific Features**: Integrating multiple vendors' tools under each drift type can be complex and may lead to underutilization of specific vendor strengths.
2. **Potential Bias Towards Certain Drift Types**: The module may become biased towards more commonly known drift types, potentially neglecting emerging or less understood drifts.
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping the module updated with evolving understandings and categorizations of drift types may require continuous maintenance and updates.

## Conclusion

Both structuring approaches have their unique advantages and challenges. The choice between vendor-based or drift-type-based structuring should align with the specific goals, resources, and constraints of your project. We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to enhance the effectiveness and usability of this module.
